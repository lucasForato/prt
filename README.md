# PRT
## What is it?
Prt lets you create tmux sessions with a delightful and simple set of commands for those that use **neovim** and **lazygit**. To install it, follow the instructions below:

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/lucasForato/prt.git

# install it using go
go install prt
```

## How to use it?
Use the command `prt init` to start your configuration and use `prt -h` to learn the commands and possibilities with the CLI.

## Why?
This project was intended to be a learning experiment creating a tool that I wanted for my workflow, but feel free to fork it and make changes for your workflow :)
